# Face_Recognition_Python
Face Recognition in Python using OpenCV

There are 3 files:

datasetmake.py: To detect face and store them in Dataset folder

training.py: To train the stored faces using haarcascade classifier(training model) and LBPH(Recognizer)

facerecogition.py : To recognize the trained face

Works well when there is a single face in the live input.

metadata.txt file should have atleast one entry (start with a dummy entry).
